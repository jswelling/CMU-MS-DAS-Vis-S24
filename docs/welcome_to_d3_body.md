## Welcome To D3

[D3](https://d3js.org/)
is a set of tools for drawing dynamic visualizations in a browser.
The results can be beautiful and very effective, but the recipes are
messy and difficult to teach.  

D3 stands for 'Data-driven documents'.

Much of the code is Javascript on the web page itself.  It's rather
idiomatic and has a style that seems unusual to me.


Since serious javascript is outside the domain of this course, we are going
to look at the structure of D3 applications without trying to fully understand
all the details.

This means our visit to D3 must stay pretty superficial.



### First some examples

There are many at [The ObservableHQ Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery).

See also [the D3 Home Page](https://d3js.org/)


* [Treemap](https://observablehq.com/@d3/treemap)
* [Zoomable treemap](https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-treemap)
* [Sortable bar chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/bar-chart-transitions)
* [Force-directed graph](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph)
* [Tidy tree](https://observablehq.com/@d3/tree)
* [Icicle graph (zoomable!)](https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-icicle)
* [Sankey diagram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/sankey) (see also the [HuBMAP data queue](https://software.docs.hubmapconsortium.org/data-sankey/index.html))


Keep in mind, each of these is a sort of recipe.  You can copy it and
customize it, but it's not as plug-and-play as, say, seaborn.



### How does it work?

Consider this simple example from earlier:

#### The SVG for this graph

```


It looks like XML (or HTML) because it is.  When this gets inserted into
the browser page, the individual bits of the SVG structure exist as
separate entities in the browser DOM.

Let's look at this bit of SVG in the browser's developer tools.


We are used to javascript being able to change the normal elements of
HTML.  In D3, the javascript directly accesses the elements of an SGV
graph, setting them and modifying them to create the visualization.



### Why is this necessary?

It takes somewhere between 100ms and a few seconds for the browser
to pass info to the web server and get a reply.  For fully interactive
visualization in a browser, that's just too slow.

To be fully interactive, the server needs to send the data and then
leave the entire job of interactive display to code in the browser.
That means it has to be javascript.


This doesn't explain why the work of setting up the visualization isn't
more 'packaged'.  I don't understand this.  Maybe some D3 visualizations
are, but the ones I've looked at are not.



### Let's look at an example

The *d3_support* branch of our Flask server can build and dispay a
Treemap.  Let's look in some detail at the code.

The Flask side just passes data to the browser in response to the
'submit' button.  The interesting parts are all on the browser side.


#### Steps implemented in javascript

Assuming the AJAX request for data happens successfully, the
javascript code in the browser takes the following steps:
* Delete the old graph.
* Construct a new, empty SVG element inside which the new graph gets built.
* Generate a Hierarchy, a D3 datastructure used for Treemaps and other things.
* The *d3.treemap()* call adds info about the layout of rectangles to the Hierarchy.


...continuing...

* The rectangles and text labels get built by looping over the size and location data in the Hierarchy.

Once all this is done, the Treemap appears on screen.
